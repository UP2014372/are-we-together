# ðŸ“… are-we-together (in the same lecture?) ðŸŽ¶


## About <a name = "about"></a>

With the start of the new academic year, I have finally been able to attend physical lectures for the first time ever. On our course we are surprisingly not all together in the same lectures (despite there being 7 of us). 

This combined with the fact that some of us have our lectures before others makes talking about current work slightly confusing. 

This inspired me to find a way of working out who is in the same lectures, hence `are-we-together`.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

For now simply run `main.py`

**TODO**: implement flags for different week dates
### Prerequisites

All requirements are able to be installed via the `requirements.txt` file as shown below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

After running the script all output will be copied to your clipboard, simply paste as desired. 

If you are pasting into Discord then I would recommend [this plugin](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/SplitLargeMessages). 
All it does is split a message that exceeds the character limit into multiple messages, to be used with [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app).
